# Abraxas
This project will be a game that will contain a unique ability system that houses 6-8 different abilities. 
Scattered throughout each level will be enemies, hazards, and a unique task that the player must finish before progressing into the next level.
This will provide entertainment and creative approaches for the player to navigate during each level. 
This game will take place in a tall tower in which the player must climb in order to ascend to the next level.
