- **Abilities:** There will be a total of 8-9 abilities within this game. Each ability has certain aspects such as projectiles, DeBuffs, AoE, and Buffs to assist the player through the level. Many of these abilities will intertwine with the unique mechanic for each level. The UI for these abilities will be displayed in the bottom center of the player screen and are completely interactable by simply clicking on the abilityâ€™s icon. Above the ability UI, there will also be a health and a power bar. These gauges will provide the player with a sense of strategy and planning on how they wish to use their powers.
