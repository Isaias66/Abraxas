# Problem Statement

## Project Idea
Our game will be utilizing aspects of platforming, navigation, and combat in a third person view to guide the player through our tower. This tower will contain 3 levels that each will have unique environments, enemies, and platforming to engage the player. These levels will give the player different and unique abilities in order to combat the wandering enemies and navigate across moving platforms. Within each level the player will be challenged with a unique task that they must complete before moving to the next level. 

## Scope
There will only be 3 levels consisting of 2 floors per level in our game. These levels will range around small to medium in order to accommodate the platforms, enemies, and objects on each level. This amount of levels was chosen in order to dedicate more time to environment building and testing. This will give more depth to certain levels and more meaning in certain navigation. 

## Game Aspects
- **Functionality:** AI is implemented in the form of enemies. Different abilities, both offensive and defensive are implemented to help the player get through each level. Different mechanics are implemented with each level, these mechanics are talked about in more detail in a lower section.


- **Level Structure:** Level pathing will take a vertical and linear branch form. Each level will consist of 6 floors filled with different tasks and challenges. This will encourage some exploration and different routes to take while navigating through the level. Many hazards and enemies will be scattered through the level and it will be up to the player to successfully transition between each level. There will also be different moving platforms that will move in certain patterns in order to create a sense of familiarity.

- **Abilities:** There will be a total of 8-9 abilities within this game. Each ability has certain aspects such as projectiles, DeBuffs, AoE, and Buffs to assist the player through the level. Many of these abilities will intertwine with the unique mechanic for each level. The UI for these abilities will be displayed in the bottom center of the player screen and are completely interactable by simply clicking on the ability's icon. Above the ability UI, there will also be a health and a power bar. These gauges will provide the player with a sense of strategy and planning on how they wish to use their powers.

- **Enemies:** Enemies can be selected with the mouse cursor by the player. This will create a red ring around the enemy's feet letting the player know that this enemy can be attacked. This selector will only allow the player to attack one enemy at a time, making certain strategies more viable. Throughout the level there will be wandering enemies that will recognize the player and attack on sight. It will be up to the player to decide how to approach certain situations and deal with certain levels. This will encourage different play styles where the player may want to run instead of fighting back.

- **Different Mechanics:** Each level will incorporate some sort of new mechanic with it. To give an example, one level may add boost panels that push you in a horizontal direction, while a separate level adds a bounce panel, which is functionally the same to the boost panel, but works instead with vertical movement instead of the horizontal movement of the boost panel. Each level will be locked until the player finishes the given task or challenge. These are a couple of examples of the mechanics that would be added between levels.
