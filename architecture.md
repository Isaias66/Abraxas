## About Our Architecture Diagram
Within the diagram, each and every element is interlinked in one way or another, with server side objects sending data to client side objects, before those client side objects send data to the in-game objects. This can be done in reverse as well. The player controller first begins by joining the gamestate and gamemode. This is considered the source server and is where all data, input, subscribers, and other forms of code is sent back and forth to be processed. Note that the player controller and AI controller "possess" the pawn object. This allows objects such as pawn actors to be controlled (possessed) by different controllers in order to represent physical objects within the game. To help understand the diagram a little bit more, a key for the diagram itself has been included with the diagram.

Alongside the various shapes, there are arrows present, the lines themselves represent the connection between different objects that send data between themselves, then the arrow head represents which direction the data is being sent, if there are two arrow heads, then data can be sent both ways between the objects.
