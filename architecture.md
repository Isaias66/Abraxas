## Project Overview

The purpose of our project is to create a 3rd person platformer that engages the player through each floor with different enemies, hazards, and objectives.
The project will contain a ability system that will house 7-9 different abilities. The UI for this system will be located directly in the bottom center of the screen and will support a drag and drop functionality. 
The project will consist of 2-3 different floors, each floor consisting of the level. This will be scaled vertically so the player will progress through our game by navigating up the tower. 


## Key Architectural Drivers

## Architectural Style Choices

Flexibility - All the data and code that is created in our project exists in one engine. This allows us to easily modify our code, assets, blueprints, or any other aspects without relying on external sources. (e.g. Blender, Zaz)
Performance- In this project we wanted to be able to keep track of all changing events and data as the game progresses. To maintain efficiency we chose a single engine to design our project so we can edit our code without the sacrifice of performance.
