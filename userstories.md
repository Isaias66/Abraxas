## 1: Challenging Platforming
As a consumer, I would like to experience a fresh and challenging platforming game that is not cookie cutter. 

Elaboration: Players should be able to explore and combat any obstacles that stand in their way. They shouldn't feel pressured to take a certain path and have freedom of choice when navigating around each level. 

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 6-8 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Demonstrate different and branching choices when navigating each floor. Display different enemies and ability choices when encountering any enemy. Show different and unique platforms or mechanics when navigating in a floor or a level. 

## 2: Ability Functionality
As a an RPG gamer, I would like to have a easy UI to choose my abilities. I would like to experience ease of life functionality when choosing my powers.

Elaboration: Players should be able to easily access their powers and click and drag any ability they see fit. This customization should make the game friendlier to the casual player.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Demonstrate the drag and drop aspect of the ability system. The hotbar should also be customizable depending on the player's desire and comfort.

## 3: Graphic/FX
As a adventure gamer, I would be happy to see the implementation of advanced or creative special effects. I would like to see these neat graphics with the ability system and would appreciate time taken into the effects of each ability.

Elaboration: Each ability should display some sort of particle system. This could be done with the Unreal Engine Niagara system or the Cascade System. This should be seen within each cast or impact an enemy takes.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 5-9 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Each ability displays a particle or graphic effect. This must be either when the ability is casted or when the ability strikes an enemy.

## 4: Ability System
As a consumer I am interested in the finished ability system in that I hope there are more choices but not too many.

Elaboration: Most Players do not want to have too many choices of when picking abilities but want to have enough so they feel that they will be able to make their character loadout their own and they can build it to fit their playstyle.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 6-8 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Somewhere between 8-12 abilities with the ability to hotkey and use at least 6 different abilities at a time.

## 5: Ability Specificity
As a consumer I want to see a diverse ability system.

Every game that uses an ability system has a general attack ability and healing ability I would like to see the above ability system implemented with some more out of the box abilities like a cloaking, damage over time and maybe a debuff ability.

## 6: UI
As a consumer I would like to see a user interface that is beneficial for the game and gives enough information regarding stats and cooldowns.

Elaboration: Games that use abilites as a main combat system tend to have an overwelming UI that has way too much information on it all at once. I would like to see a simple UI that has health, ability coodowns, and power or mana. UI's that constantly have cooldowns, buffs, etc popping on and off the screen can be very destracting for platformers. 

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 4-8 Person-hours

Acceptance Test: A UI that taeks up no more than 1/8th of the screen but can still provide all the neccesary game information to make it effective.
