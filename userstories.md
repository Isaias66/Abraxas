## 2: Ability System
As a consumer I am interested in the finished ability system in that I hope there are more choices but not too many.

Elaboration: Most Players do not want to have too many choices of when picking abilities but want to have enough so they feel that they will be able to make their character loadout their own and they can build it to fit their playstyle.

Acceptance Test: Somewhere between 8-12 abilities with the ability to hotkey and use at least 6 different abilities at a time.

## 2.1 Ability Specificity
As a consumer I want to see a diverse ability system.

Every game that uses an ability system has a general attack ability and healing ability I would like to see the above ability system implemented with some more out of the box abilities like a cloaking, damage over time and maybe a debuff ability.
