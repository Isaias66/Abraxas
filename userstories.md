## 1: Challenging Platforming
As a consumer, I would like to experience a fresh and challenging platforming game that is not cookie cutter. 

Elaboration: Players should be able to explore and combat any obstacles that stand in their way. They shouldn't feel pressured to take a certain path and have freedom of choice when navigating around each level. 

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 6-8 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Demonstrate different and branching choices when navigating each floor. Display different enemies and ability choices when encountering any enemy. Show different and unique platforms or mechanics when navigating in a floor or a level. 

## 1.1: Jump Puzzles
As a consumer I too would like to see challenging platforming but in the form of a jump puzzle.

Elaboration: A good chunck of platformers today have some sort of puzzle system to them and I would like to see one in the form of a jump puzzle. If doesnt have to be an extremely elaborate jump puzzle but I think they are a fun obsticle to find in a platformer.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: An additional 1-3 hours

Acceptance Test: A jump puzzle of some sort in the game at some point.

## 2: Ability Functionality
As an RPG gamer, I would like to have a easy UI to choose my abilities. I would like to experience ease of life functionality when choosing my powers.

Elaboration: Players should be able to easily access their powers and click and drag any ability they see fit. This customization should make the game friendlier to the casual player.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Demonstrate the drag and drop aspect of the ability system. The hotbar should also be customizable depending on the player's desire and comfort.

## 2:1 Ability Reliability
As game reviewer I would like to see smooth and easy to use controls that helps support the games overall feel.

Elaboration: Players should be able to use different abilities within the cooldown. None of the cooldowns should be excessive and encourage different styles of play. 

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours

## 3: Graphic/FX
As an adventure gamer, I would be happy to see the implementation of advanced or creative special effects. I would like to see these neat graphics with the ability system and would appreciate time taken into the effects of each ability.

Elaboration: Each ability should display some sort of particle system. This could be done with the Unreal Engine Niagara system or the Cascade System. This should be seen within each cast or impact an enemy takes.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 5-9 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Each ability displays a particle or graphic effect. This must be either when the ability is casted or when the ability strikes an enemy.

## 4: Ability System
As a consumer I am interested in the finished ability system in that I hope there are more choices but not too many.

Elaboration: Most Players do not want to have too many choices of when picking abilities but want to have enough so they feel that they will be able to make their character loadout their own and they can build it to fit their playstyle.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 6-8 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Somewhere between 8-12 abilities with the ability to hotkey and use at least 6 different abilities at a time.

## 5: Ability Specificity
As a consumer I want to see a diverse ability system.

Elaboration: Every game that uses an ability system has a general attack ability and healing ability I would like to see the above ability system implemented with some more out of the box abilities like a cloaking, damage over time and maybe a debuff ability.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 4-6 person-hours

Acceptance Test: A diverse set of at least 6 unique abilities that will provide us (the users) with a good amount of ways to customize our character to fit our play style.

## 5.1: Ability Usefullness
As a consumer I would like to see useful abilities in the ability library.

Elaboration:
I would like to see useful abilities that will have an impact on the gameplay. For example please don't add a levetation ability if there are not any pits in the floor for the player to fall in or an ability that heals companians if there are no companians in the current version of the game.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 1-2 on top of the 4-6 from the previous story

Acceptance: Abilities that will have a least 3 uses in the game.

## 6: UI
As a consumer I would like to see a user interface that is beneficial for the game and gives enough information regarding stats and cooldowns.

Elaboration: Games that use abilites as a main combat system tend to have an overwhelming UI that has way too much information on it all at once. I would like to see a simple UI that has health, ability cooldowns, and power or mana. UI's that constantly have cooldowns, buffs, etc popping on and off the screen can be very distracting for platformers. 

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 4-8 Person-hours

Acceptance Test: A UI that takes up no more than 1/8th of the screen but can still provide all the neccesary game information to make it effective.

## 7: Enviroment
As a consumer I would like to see an engaging enviroment where the levels make sense with the theme of the game.

Elaboration: Some modern games can have engaging characters but fail to have and enviroment that the player can really imerse themselves in with those characters. I would like to see a character that engages well with the enviroment and an envirment that we, as the playerbase, can feel connected to through the character.

Effort Estimation: 8-12 hours

Constraints: none

Acceptance: A character that fits well into the enviroment and an enviroment that the character can connect to.

## 8: Enemies

As a consumer I would prefer to not see the typical enemies that most games tend to have.

Elaboration: Most games have a bandit, ghost, or skeleton, I would prefer to see enemies that work well with the enviroment. If we are in a castle some knights would work or maybe a wizard. Granted if we are in a dungeon a skeleton would make sense but if we are in the woods a skeleton would more than likely not be wondering around.

Constaints: None

Acceptance Test: Enemies that would naturally be in a given enviroment and different enemies as the enviroment changes.
