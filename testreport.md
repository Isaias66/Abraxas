## Component Testing

During the development of the combat director for the enemy AI, a separate level and world was used testing certain scenarios. This was tested on a test project solely devoted to testing certain aspects of our game. In the instance of the combat director, basic dummy pawns were configured with the combat director logic. Once this was set up, the player would then do different actions to trigger certain behaviors in the enemy AI. Examples of this scenarios include the player running away from the enemies or the player standing completely still. These behavior tests were used because they were the most probable and likely behaviors a player will show during the game. Different playstyles were tested to see how the behavior of the enemy will react. These tests were beneficial to our data because it displayed how efficient the combat director was at making in game decisions according to the players behavior. 

Certain abilities were developed and prototyped before being implemented into our project. These abilities include: Buffs, Debuffs, Projectiles, and AoE types of abilities. When initially designing these abilities, they were tested in the previously mentioned test project world. This was done to ensure that certain abilities behaved properly when used in game. This includes particle systems, collision detections, and target selections. To test these abilities another basic pawn object was programmed with the combat director and used as a test dummy. This allowed us to show that certain damages were applied correctly and that certain collisions were properly detected. Different tests were done in which the placement of the player and test enemy were in different locations. This was beneficial because it demonstrated how the abilities behaved when the player was in very close proximity to the enemy or if the player was very far away.
